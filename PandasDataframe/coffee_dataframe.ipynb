    "\n",
    "JavaBeans is growing 1.36% overall, but the data shows some clear trends:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Latte is the winner** - up 13.92%, now the top seller\n",
    "- **Cappuccino fell from 1st place** - down 11.27%, lost a lot of customers\n",
    "- **Espresso is struggling** - down 9.86%, the worst performer\n",
    "- **Americano is steady** - up 10.85%, reliable product\n",
    "\n",
    "The main takeaway: customers want milk-based drinks. JavaBeans should focus on Lattes, figure out why Cappuccinos are losing customers, and decide what to do with Espresso. The business is depending on the success of Lattes."
